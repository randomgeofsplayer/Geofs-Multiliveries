# Geofs-Multiliveries
**A livery addon authored by Spice 9 and Ariakim Taiyo:**<br>
Adds `452` new liveries to the simulator.<br>
Features new liveries for the A319-100, A320neo, 787-10, 787-9, P8, and the 737-MAX 8. <br>
Partial multilayer visibility is supported; Only those who are using this addon will see custom liveries.<br>
There are "helper tags" added to supported airframes: look for the "[Mulitliveries Frame]" tag at the end of the aircraft name to see which are compatible.<br>

Here is a good tutorial by Aerospace Rules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLFyEEJZKbQ<br>

**HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:**<br>
> Download the plain texture maps from the source code,<br>
> Use an image editor to paint your livery onto the aircraft,<br>
> Export the texture file in the original resolution (IMPORTANT!),<br>
> Join our Discord server and submit your livery in the respective channel. We are looking into alternatives for those without Discord. For now though, **DO NOT** use the issues page to submit liveries. 

**Regarding 3.3 Support:**<br>
3.3 is now the official GeoFS version, and as so this addon has been updated to work on 3.3!
